# arduino-motor-control
A library for controlling various motors, stepper, encoded bldc, servo.

Library is a WIP. Stepper works fine. PID for encoded bldc is under work. 

Still need to organize and clean up, include maestro control for servos, create abstract motor base class and then implement each type of motor into its own class.
